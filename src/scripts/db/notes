TODO: normalize the metadata
(maybe keep the raw header in a BLOB, but really do we need this?)

TODO: group images in a session
* by folder (assumes user has somewhat sane file management)
* dy date/time (within 24 or more strictly?)
* by OBJECT
* by coords and/or ANGLE
* by INSTRUME
* by TELESCOP
* by FILTER => for matching flats
* by OBSERVER
* by SITENAME
* EXPOSURE => for matching darks
* CCD-TEMP/SET-TEMP => for matching darks
* XBINNING/CCDXBIN ?
* GAIN => for matching darks
* OFFSET => for matching darks

why group?
* make it presentable to the user
* store properties from normalization
  - notes?

TODO: image statistics
* median value
* stddev? noise estimate?
* ? star analysis
* ?
